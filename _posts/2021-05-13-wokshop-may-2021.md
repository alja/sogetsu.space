Zoom workshop with guidance of Hiroko Shezinski. Thursday, May 13th 2021, 10am

## Theme:
 Arrangements will not use containers, water, or fresh materials that need water. References to view: Akane Teshigahara on Instagram and the “New Challenge Exhibition” that was posted Feb 23 on YouTube. Even though they speak in Japanese, you can see the arrangements without water and get some inspirations.

We have about 6 weeks to prepare collecting materials from our home such as recycle items and dried materials. If you have any questions, please contact Hiroko-sense I or me.
