**Materials**: Dried or fresh Kiwi branches, flowers, and optionally some leaves for fillers

**Container**: Nageire or Moribana

**Theme**: Free style arrangement using the same materials and container you have just used for a Basic style arrangement.

Before the Zoom meeting please make a basic arrangement for either Nageire or Moribana and complete it. Hiroko Schezinski will give us a quick critic for each arrangement at the beginning. From there, we are going to use the same numbers of materials, same container and then create a free style arrangement. The main focus is that we are not allowed to add or miss materials we have used for the basic arrangement. If we use five stems of kiwi branches or flowers we use the same five stems for a free style.
