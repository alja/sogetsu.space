## Notes
We have Room 101 reserved for October 21-24 for our Flower Show. If Balboa Park rooms are not open by October we can do a virtual Flower Show on Zoom. This decision (in-person or virtual) can be made in August. This allows enough time to communicate plans with members and people who would like to attend.
